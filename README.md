### Let's Perform Analysis and Develop Together ðŸ¥· ! 

As a MSDS student at Columbia University, I am looking for an data scientist internship in summer 2022. 

Majored in Mathematics in my undergraduate program, I have been dealing with numbers and data all the time. Mathematics has been amazing me by its magic power to explain everything that happens in the world with the most straightforward words. Of all the fields that applied mathematics, data analysis and data science has attracted me most to explore more of it in the future for its beneficial use in the community. 

I learned data structure, algorithm and programming with Python and C++ as well as SQL. And I have experience in machine learning projects. Having read the book Visualize This: The Flowing Data Guide to Design, Visualization, and Statistics Wrote by Nathan Yau that endowed me with a broad understanding of data visualization and application.
